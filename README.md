# CONFED â’¶

A [Sails v1](https://sailsjs.com) application aimed to provide an organising platform for groups, based on anarcho syndicalist principles of organising. This Confed app uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

This is an exploration of building an anarchist decision making system based on a model of federations affiliated with the [ASF-IWA](https://www.asf-iwa.org.au), the Australian section of the [International Workers Association](https://www.iwa-ait.org)

Members will be able to form groups by inviting other members, or starting their own 'Initiative' in search of other members. Members can only be connected to one group.

**Groups** are affiates of **Locals**

**Locals** are affiates of **Regionals**

**Regionals** are affiates of **Federations**

**Federations** are affiates of **Confederations**

Discussions around the features and planning is available via Anoki.io Discourse linked below.

### Version info

This app was originally generated on Fri Jun 07 2019 03:54:42 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time) using Sails v1.2.2.

<!-- Internally, Sails used [`sails-generate@1.16.12`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate/tree/v1.16.12/lib/core-generators/new). -->


<!--
Note:  Generators are usually run using the globally-installed `sails` CLI (command-line interface).  This CLI version is _environment-specific_ rather than app-specific, thus over time, as a project's dependencies are upgraded or the project is worked on by different developers on different computers using different versions of Node.js, the Sails dependency in its package.json file may differ from the globally-installed Sails CLI release it was originally generated with.  (Be sure to always check out the relevant [upgrading guides](https://sailsjs.com/upgrading) before upgrading the version of Sails used by your app.  If you're stuck, [get help here](https://sailsjs.com/support).)
